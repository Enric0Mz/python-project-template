# Python Project Template

This repository serves as a **base template** for Python projects, providing a modern, robust foundation with essential developer tools and best practices pre-configured.

---

## Features

- **Dependency Management** with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for easy package and virtual environment management.
- **Code Formatting** enforced by [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for consistent, opinionated style.
- **Linting and Static Analysis** using [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/) and [Mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for clean and type-safe code.
- **Pre-commit Hooks** configured to automatically check formatting, linting, and commit message conventions before every commit.
- **Commit Message Standardization** via [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) enforcing Conventional Commits to keep history readable and changelogs automated.
- **EditorConfig** support to ensure consistent editor settings (indentation, line endings, whitespace) across different IDEs and editors.
- **Testing** setup with [pytest](https://pytest.org/) (pre-installed and ready to use).
